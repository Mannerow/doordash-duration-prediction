# doordash-eta-prediction

## Problem Description

The objective of this project is to predict the delivery duration for DoorDash orders using historical data. This involves developing a machine learning model that can accurately forecast the time it will take for a delivery to reach the customer from the moment an order is placed. The project will leverage MLOps principles to ensure robust experimentation, model tracking, monitoring, and automation throughout the development and deployment lifecycle.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains various features related to DoorDash orders, such as pickup and drop-off locations, timestamps, order size, and other relevant attributes. The dataset can be found at DoorDash ETA Prediction Dataset.

## Authentication

1. Place kaggle.json in .kaggle folder to faciliate downloading the dataset.
